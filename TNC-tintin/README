Hello. This is the tintin++ soundpack, version 1 for The night by Jason. This soundpack is under heavy construction, as it's the first version, and will be updated as I go. If you have any suggestions, comments, feature requests, or bugs, please send an email to:
soundpacks at mail dot com
Note: replace "at" with  "@" and "dot" with a "."
with:
Client, Game, Complaint/bug/comment/feature request 
in the subject line and the message in the body. An example would be:
Subject: tintin, the night, feature request
and in the body something like
Can you please add sounds to dogs.

This soundpack, as well as my others are licensed under the LGPL license. You may modify, distribute, and claim work on these packs, as long as the original author has been credited. I make no claims to any guarantee, warranty, or liability for these packs, as well as it is not my responsibility for lack of sleep due to game play.

### installation and running:
1. install tintin. This was installed on my machine, running ArchLinux, so the package can be gotten from the Arch User Repository using your favorite search tool. 
Search for and download Tintin. Mine is cower, so here is the example:
cower -d tintin
then go into the folder, and build it, and install it:
cd tintin
makepkg -s
sudo pacman -U tintin
note: use tab complete after tintin, to finish as your naming scheme wil be different than mine.
if using Ubuntu or other derivitives, a command such as this should work:
sudo apt-get install tintin
2. You also need Sox, with .wav support. Again, this is the arch command, so mileage may vary.
sudo pacman -S sox wavpack
3. Running the soundpack. You've unzipped the folder, and followed the instructions, so here is the rest.
Go into the TNC-tintin folder
cd TNC-tintin
run tintin loading the pack:
tt++ tn.tin
You should be greeted with startup music.

###variables, and setting them up
There are a number of variables I have helped to configure for the game, but most are empty. The only one pre-set is the volume variable, which on this pack, is set to 
roughly 40 percent. Here is the variable list to help with customizing your game, and how to set them:
Setting Volume:
vol or volume ###
use a decimal in the ###, such as .25 for 25 percent, or 1.25 for one-hundred twenty-five percent. example is: vol .25 or volume .25
setting up firearms and holsters
I suggest using different named guns, and holsters for this to work properly. I have configured up to 3 firearms, and 3 holsters for this. We'll use your first choice of 
gun, and holster for this:
set gun1 gunname
set holster1 holstername
Examples:
set gun1 mp-5
set holster1 rifle sling
This will always draw an MP-5 from a rifle sling. You can follow the same steps to assign gun2, gun3, holster2, and holster3.
bladed weapons are the same as firearms, but a different variable. You have two (2) bladed weapons and sheaths that will be saved.
set pull1 bladename
set sheath1 sheathname
Example: set pull1 dagger
set sheath1 bone sheath
Always setting our dagger to be pulled from, and sheathed into a bone sheath. Again, I would suggest buying 2 different sheath types for this not to be confused. To set 
the second blade and sheath, use pull2 and sheath2.
Phones:
Most people have 1 phone, but some have 2. I have 2 slots you can save a phone in. To set:
set phone1 phonename
set phone2 phonename
If you have two of the same phone, use more of a name to match correctly. Example with a longer name would be:
set phone1 thin midnight black
Cars:
Not everyone has a car, but here is how to set it if you do:
set mycar car name
Again, you can use a one name setup, or a longer string to match if you know someone had a car like your make. Two examples are:
set mycar bmw
set mycar black bmw convertable coupe

Variables to be saved can be as few, or as many words as you wish.

### aliases
There are many aliases I ahve used to help with some ease of typing. They were cleared by the hosts, so all are safe. Thre are no botting scripts, and I refuse to build 
them in, so don't even bother emailing me and asking for anything like it.
There aliases are:
ltime - gets your computer's time and date
od - open door
cd - close door
ld - lock door
ud - unlock door
gd - go door

lg - lock gate
gg - go gate
ga - go arch
gb - go bridge
os - open step/stair
cs - close step/stair
us - unlock step/stair
ls - lock step/stair
gs - go step/stair
Note for steps and stairs. The aliases have worked for every step, stair, or anything containing either of those words I have run across. If you find a place that they 
don't, please let me know, and I'll fix them/add to them.
t1 - talk on first saved phone
t2 - talk on second saved phone
text1 - text with irst saved phone
text2 - text with second saved phone
phone1 - use first saved phone

### final notes for now
As I said, this is somewhat of a starter soundpack to help the visually impaired. It is constantly being worked on, and added to, and eventually will have more vehicle 
sounds, and other activities sounded off as well. Give me time please to addthings if you ask for them, this isn't an overnight thing. Hopefully this is enough for now, 
and as things will bechanging, I will be changing the pack to keep up. Thank you for using my soundpack.
